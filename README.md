### Dataset:
After reviewing the datasets used in the [Character-level Convolutional Networks for TextClassification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.01626.pdf) papers,
we found that the [Yelp Reviews Dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset) satisfies most requirements for our task.<br/>
Yelp's dataset is a mid-sized dataset that could be used for various **Text-Classification** tasks thus replacing the need for other datasets
and should be compatible we our available resources. <br/>
